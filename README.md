> **Note:** Ensure the following folders and files are initialized before running the project:
>
> - Create the `dataset_faces/` directory for storing face images.
> - Create the `models/` directory for saving trained models.
> - Place `yolov8n.pt` (YOLOv8 weights) in the project root, or let it download automatically on first run.
> - If `trained_face_model.yml` and `labels.txt` do not exist in `models/`, they will be generated after training.
>
> You can initialize the folders using these commands:
>
> ```bash
> mkdir -p src/dataset_faces 
> mkdir -p src/models
> ```

## üíª Usage

### Step 1: Capture Face Images

Run the image capture script to collect training data for known persons:

```bash
python src/capture_image.py
```

- Enter the person's name when prompted
- Face the camera and press 'q' to stop capturing
- Images will be saved in `dataset_faces/[person_name]/`

### Step 2: Train the Face Recognition Model

Train the model with captured face images:

```bash
python src/train_dataset.py
```

This will:
- Process all images in the `dataset_faces/` directory
- Train the LBPH face recognizer
- Save the trained model to `models/trained_face_model.yml`
- Generate a labels file mapping IDs to names

### Step 3: Run the Surveillance System

Start the main surveillance application:

```bash
python src/CodeWithAlertMessage.py
```

Features active in this mode:
- Real-time face recognition with name display
- Unknown person detection with ID assignment
- Object detection using YOLOv8
- Pose estimation overlay
- Automated email alerts after 30 seconds of unknown person presence
- Press 'q' to quit

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Email Alert Settings

Edit the email credentials in `CodeWithAlertMessage.py`:

```python
sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
receiver_email = "receiver_email@gmail.com"
password = "your_app_password"  # Use Gmail App Password
```

**Important**: For Gmail, enable 2-factor authentication and generate an App Password at [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).

### Detection Thresholds

Adjust detection parameters in `CodeWithAlertMessage.py`:

```python
# Face recognition confidence threshold
confidence < 80  # Lower = stricter matching

# Unknown person alert timer (seconds)
elapsed_time > 30  # Time before sending alert

# Face detection parameters
scaleFactor=1.2
minNeighbors=5
```

## üîß How It Works

### Face Recognition Pipeline

1. **Image Capture**: Collects multiple face images for each person
2. **Face Detection**: Uses Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in images
3. **Model Training**: Trains LBPH face recognizer with labeled face data
4. **Recognition**: Compares detected faces against trained model
5. **Classification**: Identifies persons as "Known" (with name) or "Unknown" (with ID)

### Alert System

1. Continuously monitors video feed for faces
2. Assigns unique IDs to unknown persons
3. Tracks presence duration of unknown individuals
4. Triggers email alert after 30 seconds of continuous unknown presence
5. Sends alert with captured frame and detection details
6. Prevents duplicate alerts for the same person

### Multi-Model Integration

- **Face Recognition**: OpenCV LBPH for facial identification
- **Object Detection**: YOLOv8 for detecting and classifying objects
- **Pose Estimation**: MediaPipe for human body keypoint detection
